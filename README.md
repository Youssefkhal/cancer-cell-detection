# Cancer Cell Detection with YOLOv5 ðŸ§¬ðŸ©º

This project demonstrates the use of **YOLOv5** for detecting **cancer cells** in breast radiology images using a custom-trained deep learning model.



---

## ðŸ§  Overview

I trained a YOLOv5 model to detect cancer cells using a small medical image dataset. The model was trained for **20 epochs** due to **limited hardware resources**.

- **Model:** YOLOv5 (custom trained)
- **Framework:** PyTorch + Flask
- **Application:** Cancer cell detection from microscopy images
- **Training duration:** 20 epochs  
- **Performance:**  
  - `mAP@0.5`: ~36%  
  - `mAP@0.5:0.95`: ~17.8%

Despite limitations, this project is a step toward applying AI in **medical imaging and diagnostics**.
